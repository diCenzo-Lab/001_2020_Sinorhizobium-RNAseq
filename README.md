Fagorzi C, Bacci G, Huang R, Cangioli L, Checcucci A, Fini M, Perrin E, Natali C, diCenzo GC, Mengoni A. (2021) Nonadditive transcriptomic signatures of genotype-by-genotype interactions during the initiation of plant-rhizobium symbiosis. mSystems. 6(1): e00974-20.

Provided in this repository are the scripts, relevant input files, and key output files for our analysis of the transcriptional response of *Sinorhizobium meliloti* to *Medicago sativa* root exudates. If you use adaptations of any of these scripts or pipelines as part of your work, please cite our article.

All scripts are provided in the scripts folder. The function of the script is written within each script. The files ending with .dat are binary files required by the scripts.

The heatmap folder contains data related to the heatmaps presented in the manuscript.

The functional_analysis folder contains data related to the COG and KEGG annotation of the differentially expressed genes.

The strain_sig_data folder contains summary data of the differentially expressed genes.
