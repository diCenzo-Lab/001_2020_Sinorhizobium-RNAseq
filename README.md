# Sinorhizbium-RNAseq-2020

Provided in this repository are the scripts, relevant input files, and key output files for our analysis of the transcriptional response of *Sinorhizobium meliloti* to *Medicago sativa* root exudates.

All scripts are provided in the scripts folder. The function of the script is written within each script. The files ending with .dat are binary files required by the scripts.

The heatmap folder contains data related to the heatmaps presented in the manuscript.

The functional_analysis folder contains data related to the COG and KEGG annotation of the differentially expressed genes.

The strain_sig_data folder contains summary data of the differentially expressed genes.
